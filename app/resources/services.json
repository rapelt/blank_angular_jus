Please note that the regulator has granted a class exemption from design and item registration and annual inspections for certain inflatable amusement devices - see the resource<strong> Exemptions to the Workplace Health and Safety Regulation 2011</strong>.</p>\n\n<h5><strong>Truck-mounted concrete placing units with booms</strong></h5>\n\n<p>The WHS Regulation 2011 has expanded the registration of truck-mounted concrete placing units with booms to include all concrete placement units with delivery booms.&nbsp; If you hold a current registration for a truck-mounted concrete placing unit with boom, this will be automatically changed over to the new title of &#39;concrete placement unit with delivery boom&#39;.&nbsp; If you receive your renewal notice and the old terminology is still being used, this will be corrected when your registration certificate is printed.&nbsp; There is no need to contact WHSQ to have this changed prior to the renewal of your registration.</p>\n\n<h5><strong>Changes to inspection requirements</strong></h5>\n\n<p>The PCBU that is in control of an item of registrable plant must now keep a record of all tests, inspections, maintenance, commissioning, decommissioning, dismantling and alterations of plant for the period that the plant is used or until lthe person relinquishes control of the plant.&nbsp;

The focus is on achieving protection of the environment in Queensland and practice environmental management and compliance in accordance with ecologically sustainable development principles.</p>\n\n<h4>What Support is Provided?</h4>\n\n<p>The Department of Environment and Heritage Protection provides technical assistance in relation to environmental planning and impact assessment matters in Queensland through its free pre-design conferencing service. Business is encouraged to formally apply to the Department for a pre-design conference at which Departmental officers will contribute to the screening, scoping, assessing and reviewing of proposals, offer technical and procedural advice and explain the decisions required under various statutes.</p>\n\n<p>Where proposals require no formal impact assessment, technical advice may still be provided.</p>\n\n<p>Where development and approval applications require consideration by the Queensland Government, the Department will often be a concurrence agency but may be the assessment manager pursuant to the Sustainable Planning Act 2009, subject to certain conditions. The State Development and Public Works Organisation Act 1971 enables the Coordinator-General to designate, significant projects and to require such projects to be subject to an environmental impact statement. Assessment through an environmental impact statement process may alternatively be required under the Sustainable Planning Act, administered by the Department of Local Government.</p>\n\n<p>The Environmental Protection Act 1994 deals with the environmental approvals for the management of environmentally relevant activities (as defined in the Act) mining, gas and petroleum projects, including procedures for applications and their assessment. The Department is responsible for coordinating the assessment process including any requirements for an environmental impact statement under this Act.</p>\n\n<p>The Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) (Cwealth) may trigger Commonwealth decisions. The EPBC Act provides for environmental assessment and approval of actions that are likely to have significant impact on matters of national environmental significance as well as actions involving Commonwealth land, and actions undertaken by Commonwealth agencies. EPBC Act Policy Statements assist people to determine whether an action they are proposing to undertake should be referred to the Commonwealth Government Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities for a decision on whether environmental assessment and approval is required under the EPBC Act. A bilateral agreement is in place between the Commonwealth and the Queensland government to streamline the assessment process.</p>",

You must not discharge trade waste into sewerage other than under an approval issued or given by a local government under the Water Act 2000.</p>\n\n<p>You must lodge an application, signed by the owner, or duly authorised agent, and the generator, at the following times in respect of any premises where trade waste is generated or likely to be generated:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>during the processing of a building application for new premises or extensions intended for industrial and/or commercial usage;</li>\n\t<li>by a change in tenancy of such premises;</li>\n\t<li>by a shop fit out of such premises;</li>\n\t<li>during the processing of an application to strata title such premises;</li>\n\t<li>from existing premises where trade waste is generated and no permit/agreement has been issued; or</li>\n\t<li>by a change of ownership of a premises.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You cannot discharge prohibited substances and stormwater to sewer.

Prohibited substances are detrimental to the sewerage system and can injure the councils personnel.</p>\n\n<p>Trade waste approval is required for a wide range of business activities. Examples of business activities that require trade waste approval are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>food and beverage preparation</li>\n\t<li>manufacturing, including food and beverages, textiles, leather, paper, wood and plastic, tanneries, wool processing, glass, plaster, resin, ceramic or brick manufacture and stone working</li>\n\t<li>farms or clubs using organic and inorganic fertilisers, weedkillers or insecticides</li>\n\t<li>mining</li>\n\t<li>abbatoirs and butchers</li>\n\t<li>metal processing, finishing, fabricating or engineering operations</li>\n\t<li>hospitals, dental clinics, veterinary clinics and educational, testing or research laboratories</li>\n\t<li>vehicle and plant-related businesses including truck drivers, car parks and transport depots, panel beaters, spray painters, car washes, service stations, wreckers, plant, vehicle and equipment hire and washing</li>\n\t<li>cleaning services, dry cleaning, carpet cleaning, bottle washing and laundry operations</li>\n\t<li>swimming pool operations</li>\n\t<li>any business activities that involve chemicals such as petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, inks, paints, photographic chemicals, soaps and detergents.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The discharge of illegal substances costs the community money by blocking the sewerage system, damaging components and adversely affecting the treatment process.</p>\n\n<h4>On-site pre-treatment</h4>\n\n<p>You can have most prohibited substances such as oil, grease, gross solids, etc. removed by on site pre-treatment. Pre-treatment can be by grease or silt arrestors. You must have this equipment serviced in accordance with the conditions of the trade waste approval issued for the business operation.</p>",
